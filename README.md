# Temperature_monitoring_system
The following is based on monitoring temperature with the help of Linear Monolithic or LM35 sensor and a bolt module wherein we specify a range of temperature such that whenever a machine or an appliance exceeds that limit it tends to send an sms to you warning about the temperature anomaly.For this you need to have an account in Twilio which will give you a number from which the sms is sent to the user.
